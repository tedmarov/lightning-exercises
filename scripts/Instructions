1. Copy and paste the following code in the body of your index.html and in main.js
<div>
<button onClick='console.log(explicit())'>explicit block</button>
<button onClick='console.log(implicit())'>implicit block</button>
</div>
function explicit() {
  return 'a'
 }
function implicit() {
  'a'
 }
When you click the buttons, what output do you get in your console? Is it what you expected? Why or why not?
2. Copy and paste the following code in the body of your index.html and in main.js  and refresh your browser.
<br>
<div>
<button onClick='console.log(implicit2())'>implicit 2</button>
<button onClick='console.log(explicit2())'>explicit 2</button>
</div>
...
const implicit2 = () => 'thing'
const explicit2 = () => {
   return 'thing'
 }
When you click the buttons, what output do you get in your console? Is it what you expected? Why or why not?
3a. Copy and paste the following code in main.js , return a condition for filtering all numbers greater than or equal to 10. Refresh your browser.
