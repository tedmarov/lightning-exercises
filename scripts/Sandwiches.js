// 1. Define a function called "makeSandwich" that takes 4 parameters: protein, cheese, veggie, bread
export const makeSandwich = (protein, cheese, veggie, bread) => {
    var sandwichObject = {
    prote: protein,
    cheez: cheese,
    veg: veggie,
    carb: bread
    }
    return sandwichObject
}

// 2. makeSandwich should create a new sandwich object with the 4 parameters as its key/value pairs


// 3. makeSandwich will return our newly created sandwich


// 4. Call it a few times passing in different arguments to make different sandwiches!
